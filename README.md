# Kaggle IEEE Fraud Detection Challenge

This project was a part of my second assignment in Data Science Fundamentals under Steven Skiena which involved participating in an ongoing Kaggle challenge. This project involved solving the questions posted in 
"Kaggle Challenge"



## Getting Started

Running the ipynb file in collab or py files in local setup.

### Prerequisites

Python setup on your local machine. Preferred version: 3.x


## Tech stack

- Python

## Authors

Contributors: Abdullah Mitkar

## Note

This was a project which was meant to get us acquainted with preprocessing data, visualising data.

The model is trained using Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
The accuracy of the model in Kaggle in 74% under Linear Regression.

Only a few features of the data presented were used to train the model.

The zipped files train_transaction.zip and test_transaction.zip are train_transaction.csv and test_transaction.csv
